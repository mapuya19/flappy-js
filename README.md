# flappy-js
flappy-js is a flappy bird game originally made with Processing and ported to p5.js.
The Processing version can be found [here](https://github.com/mapuya19/flappy).

## Setup
In order to run the game locally, you must run on a live server.
A simple way to do this would be to use an extension such as [Live Server Web](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-server-web-extension/) for Firefox.

## Hosted Version
If you cannot host a local server, the game is live on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/914170).

## Gameplay / Controls
Space Bar or Left Click to jump. Get as far as you can without hitting the pipes or the ground.
